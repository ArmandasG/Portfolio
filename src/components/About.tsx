            <p>
            Hello! My name is Armandas and I enjoy creating things for the web.
            My interest in web development started in 2019 but it was put on
            hold until the time was right for me to change my career path. In
            2021-2022 I took a deep dive in learning to write code and etc... </p>
            <p>In 2023 spring I finished my courses and around 2023 autumn I finished <a className="text-[#5e98ce] sliding font-semibold" href="https://armandas-online-1-shop.netlify.app/">my first online shop</a>
            , made some <a className="text-[#5e98ce] sliding font-semibold" href="https://github.com/ArmandasG?tab=repositories">starter shells</a> for learning new
            technologies and was hired by Summum Bit, UAB as a Junior Full Stack Developer in 2023 November. My main focus these days is working on and learning as much as
            possible about the web/computers/science beneath it. While implementing my gained experience in my current work environment </p> 
            <p> In Summumbit UAB I am currently working on various projects that involve building modules from the ground, expanding and refactoring legacy code, integrating various API&#39;s and etc...</p>
            {/* <p> I am
            also currently making another booking/game website with Node JS, Next JS
            and TS and will most likely be using some sort of APIâ€™s.
          </p> */}
